                    <h4>Sophanne Needs Help to Fight Cancer!</h4>
                    <h5>October 20, 2019</h5>
                    <div class="a-p">
                        <p>Our sweet senior Miniature Pinscher mix, Sophanne needs our help! We rescued Sophanne in December after she spent weeks on the cold shelter floor. She was passed over because she was older and had a mass on her muzzle.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after we rescued her, vets removed the mass. However, it has returned and is cancerous. After testing and consultation, the oncologist believes Sophanne’s cancer can be treated and she has a great shot to beat this!</p>
                        <p>But treatment won’t come cheap, WE NEED HELP! We are starting a GoFundMe campaign to help Sophanne beat this cancer! If you are unable to donate, please share this post or our GoFundMe campaign. Every little bit counts!</p>

                        <p>Hi! I thought you’d like an update, as you can see Savannah gets along great with Stella aka Ida my other rescue from you. The two spend hours playing together and Savannah idolizes Stella. She is a joy and we are so glad we got to adopt her!</p>

                    <h4>Fostering an Animal: Instant Love</h4>

                        <p>Friend of Much Love George Hobbs wrote this beautiful essay on how fostering for an animal rescue (George was a wonderful foster for Much Love for many years) is a way to give love and get love. A perfect thought as we walk into 2014 with our four-legged friends! You can find this and George’s other brilliant musings on his blog, Hobbs in Babylon. And click here if you’re interested in fostering for Much Love in 2014!.</p>
                        <p>As another new year dawns, many of us are making resolutions, and fantasizing about how this one is going to be different. “2014 will be the year when I find love, happiness and a sense of fulfillment in my life,” we say to ourselves. “This year, I’m going to give something back. I’m going to do my small part, to make this world a better place.”</p>
                        <p>Are you saying that this year? Is your resolution to reduce stress, bring your blood pressure down, or improve your overall quality of life? Or would you simply like to come home after a long day, and find someone there who is genuinely happy to see you?</p>
                        <p>If so, I have the resolution you are looking for, and it won’t cost you a penny. All you have to do is add water.</p>
                        <p>Are you ready? Foster a pet. I didn’t say adopt, I said foster, a cat or dog.</p>

                    <h4>Radar Love: This Much Love Dog Gives Back By Doing Homechecks!</h4>
                    <h5>july 15, 2019</h5>
                    <a class="readmore" href="radar.html">Read more</a>
                    <div class="d-p">
                        <p>Radar, formerly know as “Little Tuna” when he was up for adoption as a Much Love dog, has done over 100 home checks for potential foster and adoptive homes for us! Radar’s parents, Larry S. and Jeanne P. are some of our most generous supporters, and Larry, Radar’s proud papa, is a lead volunteer and home checker extraordinaire. But the key to Larry’s mojo is his co-pilot Radar.</p>
                        <p>Radar was adopted on 10-20-11 when he was about 3 months old. His Mom was also a Much Love dog, Mahi Mahi (get the theme here?) and broke water in the back of one of our Board members’ car on the way from the South Central Shelter. Apparently shelter dogs try to hold off from giving birth until they get out of the shelter, and when Radar, in utero, sensed he was in a safe environment, he began to swim to shore! “Little Tuna” was too big however, and Dr. Lavac had to do an emergency c-section after 6:00pm on a Friday…..what a dramatic tale!</p>
                        <p>But if any of you have ever met Radar–maybe he did YOUR home check?–you know he put that drama behind him and is the mellowest of sorts!</p>
                        <p>We hope that this tale of a Much Love dog paying it forward inspires you to foster for or adopt from Much Love. Fostering is the back bone of our rescue effort–the more foster homes we have, the more dogs and cats we can get out of the shelter. It’s just that simple. Let Radar’s hard work point you in the direction of bringing a Much Love dog or cat into your home. Please contact us at info@muchlove.org if you have any questions or to get the process started!</p>

                        <p>Summer has officially arrived! Time for the return of Barks, Bubbles and Brews! On Sunday, June 29th, Much Love volunteers will be at Angel City Brewery, at 216 S. Alameda St. from 12 to 3, ready to wash your dirty dog.</p>
                        <p>For a $10 donation, you’ll not only get a clean pup, but a pint of beer from the Public House, Angel City’s 19-tap bar, serving a great selection of classic and craft beer. Dogs are welcome at the Public House. If they ask nicely, they may even get a spent barley biscuit.</p>
                        <p>Last summer, Much Love held four B, B and B events. Volunteers had fun washing dogs in a variety of shapes and sizes, and got a pretty good soaking themselves. They were treated to lunch from the Southern Fried Vegan food truck. Even better, they raised a lot of money for adoptable pets.</p>
