                        <p>Sammy is a sweet boy somewhere between 3-4 years old. A pure-bred wire hair fox terrier, his life thus far hasn’t been the easiest but he is ready for a new home that is ready to give him the love he deserves!</br></br>He needs help with potty training as he was rarely let outside, and didn’t get socialized properly so he gets nervous easily . . . Sammy will need a patient new home that’s willing to get him lots of training. He is up to date on immunizations, is friendly and gets along with other dogs for the most part, but again, will need training to make him the best doggy he can be.</br></br>He deserves a home were he can be a true family member- take walks, run outside  and be snuggled. He is energetic (like most terriers!) – but so sweet and is excited to meet you!</p>

                        <p>Shih Tzu mix TinTin is a truly multidimensional pup – cheerful and friendly, but also quiet and serious. He loves to be outside and has lots of energy to explore. This fella is still working on his potty training, but he’ll be a loving (more kisses than you’ll know what to do with!) and loyal companion to whoever opens their home and heart to him along with his brother, Hero. They are a bonded pair so we are looking for a home that can take on both of these sweet boys.</p>

                        <p>Max is full of personality and charm. He is great with other dogs and very friendly with people. He’s young and has a medium energy level. He will make a great walking buddy or companion for another playful, friendly dog.</br></br>Max is bonded with his brother Stewie and must be adopted together.</p>

                        <p>Cody is a loyal, friendly boy! He has experienced a lot of change over the past couple years including the sudden loss of his primary caregiver due to cancer.  Since rescuing him, Cody has quickly become a Much Love favorite  – he is playful, affectionate and very intelligent.</br></br>He loves the outdoors and when not out for a walk, he enjoys sitting in the sun and taking in his surroundings. When indoors, Cody is quiet and happy to be by his owner’s side, relaxing or playing with toys.</br></br>Cody is at his best when he is with people so the preference is a home where Cody is not alone all day. He is completely housebroken and will let you know when he has to go out. He does well with other dogs, especially ones that are larger than him. Cody would be best in a home that has teens rather than young children.</p>
